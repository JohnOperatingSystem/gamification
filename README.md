# Gamification of Health and Fun

## Project Overview
This project is a gamified system that tracks user activities such as running, studying (textbooks), and resting. Users earn **hedons** (fun points) and **health points** based on their actions. Special **stars** can temporarily boost rewards, while factors like **tiredness** and **boredom** influence outcomes. The goal is to encourage strategic planning and maintain engagement through a playful health-tracking system.

## Features
- Track activities: `running`, `textbooks`, `resting`.
- Calculate **health points** for each activity.
- Calculate **hedons (fun points)** based on activity and current state.
- Introduce **star bonuses** for activities to increase hedons.
- Track **tiredness** and reduce hedons if performing activities while tired.
- Prevent overuse of stars by implementing **boredom** logic.
- Suggest the **most fun activity per minute** based on current state.
